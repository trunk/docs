# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Trunk! This guide walks you through integrating a custom MCP (Multi-Channel Protocol) server into Claude's desktop application using the Trunk SDK. 

You can find the Trunk SDK on npm at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trunkai/trunk-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trunkai/trunk-sdk).

You can add the precompiled version of the Trunk SDK to your project by adding the following to your mcp client config

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "Trunk": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "@trunkai/trunk-sdk"
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

## 🛠 Setup

### 1. Make the Build Script Executable

In the root of your project:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

### 2. Run the Build Script

```bash
./build.sh
```

This compiles the project and prepares the MCP server entry point in the `dist/` directory.

## ⚙️ Configure Claude Desktop

### 3. Open Claude Configuration

Use your code editor to open the Claude desktop config file:

```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 4. Add Your MCP Server Entry

Modify or add the `superagent` entry in the JSON config:

```json
"superagent": {
  "command": "/usr/local/bin/node",
  "args": ["/Users/your-username/path-to-project/dist/index.js"]
}
```

> ✅ Make sure you're using the correct absolute path to the `index.js` file in your `dist/` folder.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Ensure you're using a **recent version of Node.js**
- You can check the correct binary path with:
  
```bash
which node
```

- Confirm your version with:
  
```bash
node -v
```

---

## 💡 Tips

- Restart Claude Desktop after saving configuration changes
- Check logs for integration issues or unexpected behavior
- Ensure your build directory (`dist/`) contains the compiled MCP server
