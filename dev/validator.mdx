# Setting up a Validator Node

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a Trunk validator node. Validators play a crucial role in the Trunk network by verifying and processing transactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your validator node up and running:

1. Clone the Trunk Network repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trunk/network.git
cd network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your validator:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and set your validator configuration:
```env
VALIDATOR_NAME=my-validator
VALIDATOR_PORT=8545
NETWORK_ENV=testnet
```

4. Start the validator:
```bash
npm run validator:serve
```

Your validator should now be running and connecting to the Trunk network.

## Configuration Options

The following configuration options are available in the `.env` file:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `VALIDATOR_NAME` | Unique name for your validator | `validator` |
| `VALIDATOR_PORT` | Port to run the validator on | `8545` |
| `NETWORK_ENV` | Network environment (mainnet/testnet) | `testnet` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity | `info` |

## Monitoring

Once your validator is running, you can monitor its status:

1. View validator logs:
```bash
npm run validator:logs
```

2. Check validator status:
```bash
npm run validator:status
```

3. View network metrics at `http://localhost:8545/metrics`

## Best Practices

- Regularly update your validator software
- Monitor system resources
- Use secure credentials
- Maintain good network connectivity
- Back up your validator configuration

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Validator Won't Start
- Check if the port is already in use
- Verify Node.js version
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Network Connection Issues
- Check your firewall settings
- Verify network configuration
- Ensure your node can reach other network peers

### Performance Issues
- Monitor system resources
- Check log files for errors
- Verify hardware meets minimum requirements
