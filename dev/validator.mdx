# Setting up a Validator Node

Validators play a crucial role in the Trunk network by verifying and processing transactions. While the validator network is a core part of Trunkâ€™s architecture, **validator setup is currently in closed beta**.

If you're part of the closed beta program, follow the steps below to set up your node. Public access will be available soonâ€”stay tuned for updates.

## ðŸš§ Closed Beta Notice

Validator nodes are currently limited to a small group of early testers. If you're interested in participating, [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/trunk) and request early access.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## Quick Start (Beta Access Only)

1. Clone the Trunk Network repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trunk/network.git
cd network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your validator:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file:

```env
VALIDATOR_NAME=my-validator
VALIDATOR_PORT=8545
NETWORK_ENV=testnet
```

4. Start the validator:
```bash
npm run validator:serve
```

Your validator should now be running and connected to the testnet (if access has been granted).

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `VALIDATOR_NAME` | Unique name for your validator | `validator` |
| `VALIDATOR_PORT` | Port to run the validator on | `8545` |
| `NETWORK_ENV` | Network environment (mainnet/testnet) | `testnet` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity | `info` |

---

## Monitoring

1. View validator logs:
```bash
npm run validator:logs
```

2. Check validator status:
```bash
npm run validator:status
```

3. Metrics available at:
```
http://localhost:8545/metrics
```

## Best Practices

- Use secure credentials and access controls
- Monitor system performance and logs
- Keep your node updated with the latest releases
- Ensure reliable uptime and connectivity
- Back up your `.env` configuration regularly

---

## Troubleshooting

### Validator Won't Start
- Port might be in use
- Wrong Node.js version
- Dependencies not installed properly

### Connection Problems
- Network or firewall restrictions
- Incorrect `NETWORK_ENV` config
- Peering issues

### Performance Issues
- Insufficient hardware
- Log errors or memory leaks
- Use monitoring tools to diagnose
