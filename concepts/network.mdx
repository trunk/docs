# Network Architecture


The Trunk network operates through the **Trunk Local MCP Client**, a lightweight client that users install on their own devices.

This client is responsible for:

- Managing **seed phrases**
- Handling **environment variables**
- Storing **local content** securely

---

## How It Works

When a user performs an action, the Local MCP Client:

1. Reaches out to the Trunk network
2. Discovers available **solvers**
3. Sends a request for computation or data handling

---

## Current Phase: Testnet

- Solvers are currently **private** and used only for **internal testing**
- **MCP requests are free** during the testnet phase
- Over time, the platform will open up to **allow anyone to run a solver node**

---

## Future: Token-Powered Requests

- Once the network matures, **MCP requests will require payment in Trunk tokens**
- This introduces incentives for solver node operators and validators

---

## Post-Testnet Consensus: Competing Solvers

Once Trunk exits the testnet phase, the network will shift toward an open, competitive solver model—where multiple independent solvers can respond to MCP requests.

Here’s how the consensus mechanism will work in this phase:

---

### Multiple Solvers, One Task

When a user submits a request:

1. The network **broadcasts the task** to eligible solvers.
2. Each solver independently attempts to **process the request and return a result**.
3. Responses are collected and compared by **validator nodes**.

---

### Competitive Execution

Solvers will compete based on:

- **Accuracy**: Only correct results are considered.
- **Performance**: Faster responses are favored.
- **Reputation**: Long-term reliability improves solver ranking.
- **Stake**: Higher-staked solvers get more visibility, but not guaranteed selection.

---

### Result Validation & Finality

Validator nodes play a critical role in establishing consensus:

- They **cross-check solver responses** for consistency and correctness.
- If results match across solvers, one is selected and rewarded.
- If there's disagreement, validators perform **multi-step verification** or trigger **dispute resolution**.
- Final output is committed once validators reach consensus, ensuring fast but fault-tolerant finality.

---

### Incentive Alignment

- The **first correct solver** to return a validated result earns the majority of the reward.
- Other solvers with matching results may receive partial rewards.
- Incorrect or malicious responses result in **slashed stakes** and reduced reputation.

---

This model ensures that the network remains **decentralized, competitive, and reliable**, even as it scales to accommodate more developers and workloads.
