# Privacy Features

The Trunk network is committed to protecting user privacy at every stage. At present, all private data is managed and processed locally by the Trunk Local MCP Client, ensuring that sensitive information never leaves the user's device without protection. Looking ahead, Trunk will process private transactions inside Trusted Execution Environments hosted on the Aethir Cloud. This transition will enable secure sharing of private data, supported by TEE attestations and zero-knowledge proofs, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees for every user.


## Privacy by Design

Currently:
- **All private data stays local** on the user's device

Coming soon:
- Trunk will transition to processing private transactions inside **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** hosted on **Aethir Cloud**
- This model ensures:
  - **Secure off-device computation**
  - **TEE attestations**
  - **Zero-knowledge proof** support for privacy validation

### TEE's

#### What Are Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)?

**Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** are secure, isolated regions within a device’s processor designed to run code and handle data confidentially. Even if the main operating system or other apps are compromised, the code and data inside a TEE remain protected.

TEEs enforce strict security boundaries:

- Only authorized code can run within the environment
- Data stored and processed inside is encrypted and inaccessible to the outside world
- Integrity is verified through cryptographic **attestation**, proving that the environment hasn’t been tampered with

In the Trunk network, TEEs hosted on the **Aethir Cloud** are used to process sensitive transactions off-device while preserving user privacy. This allows private data to be securely shared and computed, with strong guarantees backed by both **TEE attestations** and **zero-knowledge proofs**.
