# Solvers

Solvers are specialized services within the Trunk network that handle computation and validation for user requests. The Trunk Local MCP Client discovers available solvers by querying the network. Currently, all solvers are private and only accessible for internal use during the testnet phase. As Trunk matures and more developers join, the network will gradually open participation so that anyone can run a solver. During testnet, all MCP requests are free. In the future, these requests will require payment in Trunk tokens. This approach ensures that private data is handled securely, both now and as the network transitions to using TEEs for enhanced privacy.

## What are Solvers?

Solvers are network participants that:
- Process complex transactions
- Validate computation results
- Ensure network efficiency
- Maintain data consistency

## Solver Types

### 1. Validation Solvers

```typescript
interface ValidationSolver {
  type: 'validation';
  capabilities: string[];
  stake: number;
  performance: {
    successRate: number;
    latency: number;
  };
}
```

These solvers focus on transaction validation:
- Verify transaction integrity
- Check signature validity
- Ensure state consistency

### 2. Computation Solvers

```typescript
interface ComputationSolver {
  type: 'computation';
  resources: {
    cpu: number;
    memory: number;
    storage: number;
  };
  specialization: string[];
}
```

Handle complex computational tasks:
- Mathematical operations
- Data processing
- Resource-intensive calculations

## Solver Selection

The network selects solvers based on:

1. **Stake Amount**
   - Higher stake = More opportunities
   - Minimum stake requirements
   - Stake slashing for misbehavior

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time
   - Success rate
   - Resource availability

3. **Specialization**
   - Task type matching
   - Resource requirements
   - Geographic location

## Implementation

### Basic Solver Setup

```javascript
import { TrunkSolver } from '@trunk/core';

class CustomSolver extends TrunkSolver {
  async validate(transaction) {
    // Validation logic
    const isValid = await this.checkTransaction(transaction);
    return {
      valid: isValid,
      reason: isValid ? 'valid' : 'invalid signature'
    };
  }

  async compute(task) {
    // Computation logic
    const result = await this.processTask(task);
    return {
      result,
      proof: this.generateProof(result)
    };
  }
}
```

### Solver Configuration

```javascript
const solverConfig = {
  type: 'validation',
  stake: 1000,
  capabilities: ['tx-validation', 'proof-generation'],
  resources: {
    maxTasks: 100,
    maxMemory: '4GB'
  }
};
```

## Rewards and Penalties

### Reward Structure

| Activity | Reward |
|----------|--------|
| Validation | 0.1 TOKEN |
| Computation | 0.5 TOKEN |
| Consensus | 0.2 TOKEN |

### Penalty Conditions

- Invalid results
- Slow response
- Offline status
- Malicious behavior

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
```javascript
class ResourceManager {
  monitor() {
    // Check CPU usage
    // Monitor memory
    // Track network I/O
  }

  optimize() {
    // Balance load
    // Clear cache
    // Adjust parameters
  }
}
```

2. **Error Handling**
```javascript
try {
  await solver.process(task);
} catch (error) {
  await solver.reportError(error);
  await solver.recover();
}
```
