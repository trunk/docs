## The Problem with Traditional MCPs

Today's model-context protocols (MCPs) are noisy and fragmented. Each new capability, like fetching a token price, adding a calendar event, or summarizing a news feed,requires manually locating a plug-in, importing its schema, wiring credentials, and handling everything from rate limits to response formats.

> Agents end up dragging a backpack of bespoke dependencies just to answer a single follow-up question.

### Example: A Simple Query
_‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the current price of SOL and how does it compare to yesterday?‚Äù_

Becomes four manual chores:

| Step                     | Pain Point                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Install price API tool   | Version clashes, API changes            |
| Configure API keys       | Secret management, rotation             |
| Parse response/timestamps| Glue code, edge cases                   |
| Rate-limit & cache       | Extra infra, stale data risk            |

**Result:** More scaffolding than intelligence.

## Runtime Architecture

    Agent["Agent"] --> SDK["Trunk SDK"]
    SDK --> Router["Trunk Router"]

    Router -->|private intents üîí| Local["Local Intent Runner"]
    Router --> Manager["‚Ä¢ Batch Manager"]
    Router --> Consensus["‚Ä¢ Consensus Verifier"]
```

## Execution Flow

Agents embed a tiny SDK (~x kB). Each MCP call is automatically routed:

- Public data ‚Üí sent to Trunk's batch manager and published on-chain.
- Private intents ‚Üí executed locally and committed as hashed records.

No extra imports. One async response.
