## A Side-by-Side Look

| Traditional MCP Workflow                                      | With Trunk                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Dozens of plug-ins with individual schemas, auth, versions    | One standard envelope, no manual imports              |
| Duplicate API hits across competing agents                   | Shared batched answers for everyone                   |
| Custom glue code per tool                                    | Unified context object; agents speak one dialect      |
| Network round-trips per tool â†’ latency spikes                | Sub-second aggregates; efficient execution            |
| No clear provenance or audit trail                           | On-chain commitments + Merkle proofs                  |

## Agent Simplicity, System Integrity

Trunk isn't just more efficient - it's **composable, auditable, and agent-friendly** by design. No more reinventing the wheel every time your agent learns a new skill.
