## Core Benefits of Trunk

### 🧩 Dependency-Free for Agents
No need to install or manage individual tools. All services are virtualized behind the protocol.

### 📦 Batching by Default
Requests are grouped into batches to reduce cost, network load, and response latency.

### 🧠 Consensus on Data Quality
A lightweight reputational mesh validates public answers. Providers are rewarded for accuracy and penalized for bad data.

### 🔐 Private-by-Design
Personal intents are executed locally. Only cryptographic commitments are published, preserving user privacy.

### 🧱 Fully Composable
High-level agent skills can be built using Trunk once and reused infinitely — no reimplementation required.
